# Meteorological-and-climate-data-analysis
This is a group project on Meteorological and climate data analysis course during my Master.


## Homework

Deadline : 16 February 2021.

    1) Groups :
        .Group 1 : BOUBAKAR, Christiane, DEGBEY,
        .Group 2: ...
        ....



    2) Objective: Get use to data analysis, extract climate signal per climatic zone.

    3) Work to do :

        Files to consider:
            • Temperature for CRU: tas_AFR-44_CRU-TS323_obs_r1i1p1_CRU_v1_mon_190101-201412.nc
            • Précipitation for CRU : pr_AFR-44_CRU-TS323_obs_r1i1p1_CRU_v1_mon_190101-201412.nc
            
#### I- Spatial analysis of Climate data over West Africa
            Analyze and plot the climatology of precipitation and temperature over West Africa ; 
            Your figures should only show West Africa with the labels well expressed.
            Consider West Africa as 0-30°N, 18°W-20°E
            Comment

#### II- Climate trend and signal analysis
In this section three groups will work separately in different climatic zones:
Group 1: Gulf of Guinea:


    1) For each group, calculate the time series of temperature anomalies and precipitation anomalies (1900-2014)
    2) Plot the time series of the climatic zone and comment
    3) overlay the linear trend and include the significance test value of the trend.
  Conclude



Good Luck
