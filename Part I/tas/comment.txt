The figure above shows that West Africa is warming. The warming is distributed over two main regions, the northen part (from 4N to 17N), where the warm is less than the southern part (from 17N to 30), where the mean temperature is very higher (up to 30 C). The warm sea surface temperature over the Gulf of Guinea induce droughts over the sahel region (Zebiak 1993; Losada et al.), which mainly characterises the northen part of West Africa. The colder sea surface temperature over the Gulf of Guinea increase the temperature gradient between the ocean and warm land over the sahel, thereby strenghering the mansoon flow and moving it further over land, hence enhancing wet conditions (Hoerling et al. 2006 and Nicholson 2013). This explain the increasing of temperature from the south to the north.
