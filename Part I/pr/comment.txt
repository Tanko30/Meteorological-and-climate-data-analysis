According to the figure above, the annual mean rainfall over West Africa is characterized by an uneven distribution of rainfall. the rainfall is abudant in the southern part (from 4N to 12N, with most important quantity of rainfall from 4N to 8N over Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia and Siera-Leone), average in the center of the region (from 12 to 17N) and almost rare in the northen part (from 17N to 30N). The abudant rainfall in the southern part can be explained by the fact that: the warm sea surface temperature over the Gulf of Guinea increase rainfall over the Guinea Coasts (Zebiak 1993; Losada et al.). On other hand a warmmer sea surface temperature over the Gulf of Guinea enhance drought over west sahel (center and northen part of west Africa) by reducing the strengh and inward penetration of the mansoon flow (Ulrich D. and Babatunde J. A., 2015).
